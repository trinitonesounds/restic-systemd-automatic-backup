# This is the default profile. Fill it with your desired configuration.
# Additionally, you can create and use more profiles by copying this file.

# This file (and other .env.sh files) has two purposes:
# - being sourced by systemd timers to setup the backup before running restic_backup.sh
# - being sourced in a user's shell to work directly with restic commands e.g.
#  $ source /etc/restic/default.env.sh
#  $ restic snapshots
#  Thus you don't have to provide all the arguments like
#  $ restic --repo ... --password-file ...

# shellcheck source=etc/restic/_global.env.sh
. "$INSTALL_PREFIX/etc/restic/_global.env.sh"

# Envvars below will override those in _global.env.sh if present.
